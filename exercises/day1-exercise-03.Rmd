### Exercise 3.1

```{r day1-exercise-03-01, echo = F, class = "target"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day1-exercise-03/day1-exercise-01-1.png")
```

* Note: the sequential palette is `ag_GrnYl` from `colorspace`.
* Note: look carefully at the format of the legend.

### Exercise 3.3

```{r day1-exercise-03-03, echo = F, class = "target"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day1-exercise-03/day1-exercise-03-1.png")
```

* Note: the color used is `#ff1a1a` are `#008000`.

### Exercise 3.4

```{r day1-exercise-03-04, echo = F, class = "target"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day1-exercise-03/day1-exercise-04-1.png")
```

* Note that the color is using the qualitative palette `Set 3`.
* Note that the fill color is `black` and `gray`.
* You can change the order of appearance of legends by guides. Say `guides(color = guide_legend(order = 1))` to change `color` to appear first.

```{r day1-exercise-03-05, echo = F, class = "target"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day1-exercise-03/day1-exercise-05-1.png")
```

* The plot shows the maximum and minimum temperatures in Celsius over time by site.
* The line colors are `#166ee0` and `#e0161d`.
